**Last Updated:** On 7 July, 2023. Welcome to the list! Since now I am using MS Edge, OneTab and The Great Suspender features are already available in MS Edge. Switched from LastPass to Bitwarden. Added Wappalyzer.

List of tools that I use and can't live without. I'll update the list as I come across something new and tested it for at least 1 week.

## Edge Extensions

I use MS Edge, here is the list of extensions that I use currently and used earlier.

1. [**Bitwarden**](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/bitwarden-free-password/jbkfoedolllekgbhcbcoahefnbanhhlh) - Free open source password manager, after lastpass stopped their multi-logging feature for free user, Bitwarden was the best free option I discovered so far.

2. [**Wappalyzer**](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/wappalyzer-technology-p/mnbndgmknlpdjdnjfmfcdjoegcckoikn) - Quick way to find out the technology stack of any website.

**Not in Use:** Below extensions are not used by me anymore.

1. [**LastPass**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lastpass-free-password-ma/hdokiejnpimakedhajhdlcegeplioahd) - It's amazing, there are times I just want to generate a super-strong password and get rid of the headache of jotting it down to a paper. Its free, 2-factor authentication, and available for android.

2. [**OneTab**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/onetab/chphlpgkkbolifaimnlloiipkdnihall?hl=en) - Just tap it and it will save all your opened tabs. The best part is it automatically presents you with the links, next time you start chrome.

3. [**The Great Suspender**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-great-suspender/klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg?hl=en) - Multitasking? I have almost 10+ tabs opened on every chrome session. Most of them I just don't use for a while. This little sweet extension automatically suspends it after a set interval of time, so no memory usage.
