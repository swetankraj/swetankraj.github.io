**Last Updated:** On 1 July, 2020. Welcome to the list!

List of tools that I use and can't live without. I'll update the list as I come across something new and tested it for at least 1 week. 

## Chrome Extensions

I use Chrome, say I stumbled upon an awesome plugin a few months ago but didn't bookmarked or save elsewhere. I just use my Google activity narrowing via date/time/month and voila its there. 

1. [**LastPass**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lastpass-free-password-ma/hdokiejnpimakedhajhdlcegeplioahd) - It's amazing, there are times I just want to generate a super-strong password and get rid of the headache of jotting it down to a paper. Its free, 2-factor authentication, and available for android.

2. [**OneTab**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/onetab/chphlpgkkbolifaimnlloiipkdnihall?hl=en) - Just tap it and it will save all your opened tabs. The best part is it automatically presents you with the links, next time you start chrome.

3. [**The Great Suspender**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-great-suspender/klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg?hl=en) - Multitasking? I have almost 10+ tabs opened on every chrome session. Most of them I just don't use for a while. This little sweet extension automatically suspends it after a set interval of time, so no memory usage.
